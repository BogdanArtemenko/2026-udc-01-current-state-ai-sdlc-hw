# Task 3: Token & Cost Analysis

## Context Size (via repomix)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total files | 105 |
| Total tokens | 70,437 |
| Total characters | 278,656 |
| Largest file | `.agents/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/AGENTS.md` — 26,362 tokens (37.4%) |

`npx repomix` was used to measure repository context size because Claude Pro's `/cost` command shows only subscription usage percentages, not exact input/output token counts or USD cost per session.

## Observations

The agent skill AGENTS.md alone accounts for **over a third** of the entire repository context. It is loaded into every conversation that reads the full repo, even when the task has nothing to do with React performance rules.

The Next.js `app/` project itself (source files, config) is relatively small — most of the token budget is consumed by the installed skill docs and the `package-lock.json`.

## Optimizations

1. **Narrow the agent context per task.** Ask the agent to read only the files relevant to the current task instead of letting it scan the whole repo. For this feature, only `app/app/page.tsx`, `app/lib/`, and `app/components/` mattered.

2. **Exclude large skill docs from default context.** The vercel-react-best-practices skill is 26k tokens. Load it explicitly only when working on performance-sensitive React code, not on every turn.

3. **Keep generated and lock files out of context.** `.claude/settings.json` already denies reading `package-lock.json` and `node_modules/`. This directly reduces per-turn input token count.

4. **Short plan → review → implement cycles.** Tight iterations with a clear plan mean fewer correction turns and less cumulative token spend compared to open-ended "just build it" prompts.
